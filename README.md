#### RocketShoes

This project is a challenge to the challenges taken to reinforce students' knowledge of the Rocketseat full stack course.

In this project I managed to absorb an excellent workflow base using Redux in conjunction with Saga, the purpose of this project was to simulate an ecommerce where the shopping cart state could be accessible and manipulated by all components of the application. We use a json file to simulate an API and consume the data within the project. It was a great experience.

### Instructions:

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn install`

After finish you can run:

### `json-server server.json -p 3333`(for simule API)

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
